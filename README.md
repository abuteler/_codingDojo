# Repository to many past one-off challenges, and personal experiments.

Condensing some of my past repositories into only one, to keep for reference while I tidy my Github profile up, and as a way to keep a copy of past coding exercises in the cloud (where no NDA was involved and signed), in case I ever were to lose my solid state files.
As part of this move, I'm letting go the individual git history of the projects/challenges that had one, and will keep an index with their names and aproximate date instead.
Lastly, if your interest has made you read this far, keep in mind that the folders that were repositories in themselves, still keep a copy of their Readme.MD, where you'll find additional context and/or instructions on how to properly install and run them.
